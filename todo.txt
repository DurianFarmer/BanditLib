1. GOBlin, PTS and UCBPMF seem to have linear or close to linear regret w/ simulation
	- Unsure if this is an issue

1. Simulation.py needs some refactoring
	 - Alot of complexity with it handling both simulation setup and dataset setup

2. Potentially add MSE recording and plotting in Dataset/Yahoo RewardManagers 
	- I think we need to change createReccommendation in lib/BaseAlg.py to get access to prediction
	- All algorithms decide functions will need to return the picked article and the predicted value 

3. Add functionality to save algorithm (ie theta values, weights for MLP) on all datasets 
	- Similar implemenations should be in CF_Bandit repo
	- MLP saving will also require saving history 
	- YahooDatasetRewardManager and DatasetRewardManager 

4. There is some inconsitency between algorithms that return a list of picked articles and a single instance of an article
	- Similarly only some algorithms have a page rank implemenation (paramater k in decide functions)
	- It is also confusing that k can only be one for algorithms on dataset

5. May want to make it easier to save figures on ssh
	- To plot when ssh'ed to UVA servers you need to include matpotlib.use('pdf') at the first location matplotlib is included
